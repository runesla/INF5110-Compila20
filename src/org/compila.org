[[../../oblig1-starting-point/compila-code/compila.cmp  
Are there any available test program to validate the correctness of our
compiler? The repo provided "compila.cmp" seem to not fully cover all
functionality of compila 18. 

Also from the languange spec:

REC_DECL -> "struct" NAME "{" { VAR_DECL ";" } "}"

compila.cmp: 

struct Complex
begin
var Real : float;
var Imag : float;
end;​

begin and end has been switched out by brackets.

* What to do better next year.

Remarks per semester, especially list of things that I did /not/ like (but
perhaps also positive things).



** 2020 

** 2018 (I guess)


- Grammar: call_stmt -> call_expr


- maybe better structure of the starting point

- make the handout for the oblig contain all the stuff
   which is also on the slides
- check the examples better.
- perhaps don't do the stupid ant-stuff (or at least
   get a better grip on it)

- perhaps don't call it starting-point


- I don't like the clause for ~VAR~ (at least the name), it's not a ``variable''

** Grammar

  - I don't like the call-statements: it's unclear
    how to give back return values




* This to do (compila)
