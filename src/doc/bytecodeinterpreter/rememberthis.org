# there are other ways to add a label here. 

To sum up, here are some important points to remember

- Always add a return statement to the end of the instructions of a
  procedure.
- Always set the main method
- add the library procedures (like ~print_int~ etc.) as procedures, but
  without instructions
- if the reference on the stack is a null reference when trying to access a
  field of it, the interpreter will print the error =Nullpointer at
  GETFIELD= or the equivalent message for ~PUTFIELD~, and the virtual
  machine will abort.
- do not hust add, but remember to update procedures, structs, and global
  variables.
- use the /list/ option (~-l~) to inspect your bytecode and even take a
  look at it with an hex editor.
