* Changes from 2019 -> 2020

  - multi-line comments written  ~(*~ and ~*)~ now.
  - introduce "BOOL_LITERALS" in the grammar (no real change)
  - variable declarations more complex: 
        - with initialization 
        - without type (may make type checking more complex)

  - in process declaration: don't make "in" mandatory
  - proc -> procedure

* Changes from 2018 -> 2019 


** Lexical

   - new keywords FI and OD (for conditionals)
  
** Grammar

- Make ";" as separator, not terminator 
   (PROGRAM and PROC_DECL changed) 


- DECL: remove ";" and the end
- if then begin ... end  -> if then ... fi
- while do begin .. end -> while do ... od
